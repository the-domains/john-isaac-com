# Things I care about

My passion is for identifying and getting involved with emergent technologies at the cusp of potential application to real-world problems, then productization and solutioning these technologies up until critical mass or market inertia/penetration is achieved around the problem space, in which case I often repeat the cycle with newly emergent technology.

Given the diversity of both these technological cycles, as well as my exposure to various problem spaces, current and past technologies I'm actively involved with and those I'm just beginning to explore are captured here by domain.
